# CC10-Polyglottal-Rust

## In the beginning

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis. It is 5 days project to learn new language.
I chose Rust.
This is my first time to use Rust.

## Compare Node.js and Rust's execution time using selection sort

This Application execute selection sort.

### Procedure
